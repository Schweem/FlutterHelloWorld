# Flutter, Hello World!
This is my first Flutter project, created following the introductory tutorial from [Google Developers' Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/). The project demonstrates various Flutter concepts, including:
- navigation
- state management
- and UI customization.

## Overview
This project is a simple app that generates random word pairs and allows users to mark their favorite pairs. It consists of two main screens:

- **Generator Page**: This page displays a randomly generated word pair. Users can mark the pair as a favorite and generate a new pair.
- **Favorites Page**: Users view their list of favorite word pairs and remove pairs from their favorites.

## Features
- Random word pair generation.
- Marking word pairs as favorites.
- Viewing and managing favorite word pairs.

This app was a brief introduction to flutter, I highly recomend the google code labs. The courses are great, the mixed media and well paced structure leads to an engaging and insightful introduction to these topics or new ideas!
